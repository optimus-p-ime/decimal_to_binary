# decimal_to_binary
A program to convert a decimal number to binary number.
This algorithm uses two variables 'num' and 'bin'. The 'bin' variable is initialized to 1.
It uses two while loops. The First while loop is used to convert the decimal number to its equivalent binary number (but in reversed order).
The second while loop reverses the computed binary equivalent and finally displays it.
